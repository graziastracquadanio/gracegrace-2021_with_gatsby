        XING is a social network for business contacts and it is the largest jobs search engine in German-speaking
        countries. I joined a brand new internal and experimental project, working mainly remotely in a
        multidisciplinary agile team, using React, Apollo, GraphQL and Jest among other in-house technologies.

        ForwardKeys is a business intelligence company that processes travel data. In 2018, the company decided to
        rebuild the old monolithic application with modern technologies and a fresh look. I was responsible for putting
        in place the frontend architecture. Our goal was to build a set of modules and components to combine them to
        quickly and consistently build new products. The living styleguide and the product web apps were built using
        Angular, SCSS, Highcharts, PrimeNG and Karma and Jasmine for the unit tests.

        HMH is a company that provides educational content and learning tools to schools. I worked on a project named
        RCE (Responsive Content Engine), an epub parser/reader with a set of tools that allows the users to interact
        with the content in a persistent way. It was written in javascript ES6 and built with the following libraries
        and tools (among others): React, Redux, Panels, Pages and Node.js.
